# Handwritten-Digits-Classification-using-Neural-Networks

In this assignment, your task is to implement a Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network and evaluate its performance in classifying handwritten digits. You will use the same network to analyze a more challenging face dataset and compare the performance of the neural network against a deep neural network using the TensorFlow library. After completing this assignment, you are able to understand:<br/>
How Neural Network works and use Feed Forward, Back Propagation to implement Neural Network?<br/>
How to setup a Machine Learning experiment on real data?<br/>
How regularization plays a role in the bias-variance tradeoff<br/>
How to use TensorFlow library to deploy deep neural networks and understand how having multiple hidden layers can improve the performance of the neural network?
